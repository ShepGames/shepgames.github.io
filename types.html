		<p class="handwriting">A database is a persistent tabular form to store data. Data is split into tables, fields (columns) and records (rows).  </p>
		<p class="handwriting">Programming Paradigm â€“ A specific way for a programming language to execute something that differentiates it from other languages.</p>

<p class="handwriting">Common types of paradigms:</p>

<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Event-Driven</h4></font>
<p class="handwriting"> A type of programming which relies on user input </p>
<p class="handwriting">to run specific actions when the user wants to, such as buttons that change parts of the program. Commonly </p>
<p class="handwriting">used in HTML websites that contain JavaScript functions.</p>
<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Object-Oriented</h4> </font>
<p class="handwriting">A type of programming which sorts different functions and variables for those </p>
<p class="handwriting">functions into objects and attributes, which can then be used to change or modify parts of the object to fit </p>
<p class="handwriting">with the execution of the program. Used often in C++.</p>
<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Procedural</h4> </font>
<p class="handwriting">A type of programming which is one of the simplest; all the code in this type runs sequentially, </p>
<p class="handwriting">one line after the other, but it can use functions to change what order the code will run in. </p>
<p class="handwriting">Often associated with Python, despite Python fitting </p>
<p class="handwriting">the previous 2 paradigm formats as well.</p>
<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Imperative</h4> </font>
<p class="handwriting">A type of programming that is heavily focused on statements to shift the state </p>
<p class="handwriting">of the program, and utilizes direct commands to do so. Object-Oriented programming was developed from <p>
<p class="handwriting">this type of paradigm, and it </p>
<p class="handwriting">is also one of the oldest paradigms of all time, as it was used in FORTRAN, developed by IBM in 1954.</p>
<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Declarative</h4></font>
<p class="handwriting">A type of programming that does not necessarily involve heavy amounts of complex language but instead </p>
<p class="handwriting">uses high amounts of logic, as the code is more focused on defining the expected output for the program than </p>
<p class="handwriting">the way it should be carried out. Used often with SQL.</p>
