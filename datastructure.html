	<h3 class="niceText">Data structures</h3>
		<p class="handwriting">Computer's need to organize data in certain ways to be most efficient in read and write</p>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Stack </h4></font><img src="assets/stack.png" alt="graph" width=60 height=30></img>
		<p class="handwriting">A first in, last out (FILO) structure which pushes values and pops them out. The first item in will go to the bottom, and if  </p>
		<p class="handwriting">other items are pushed in then it will have to wait till they are popped before it will be popped itselff.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">The advantages </p>
		<font color="green"><p class="handwriting">Great for tracking backwards like an undo button </p></font>
		
		<p class="handwriting">The dis-advantages </p>
		<font color="orange"><p class="handwriting">Takes ages to get a data item if other values are pushed into it</p></font>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Queue </h4></font><img src="assets/queue.png" alt="graph" width=60 height=30></img>
		<p class="handwriting">A first in first out (FIFO) system where The first bit of data is the first to be read. This is the most common structure  </p>
		<p class="handwriting">data is added via enqueue and taken out with the dequeue</p>
		<p class="handwriting">The advantages </p>
		<font color="green"><p class="handwriting">Data is accessed quicker after being queued</p></font>
		
		<p class="handwriting">The dis-advantages </p>
		<font color="orange"><p class="handwriting">cannot get the last bit of data added, which means high priority data will wait.</p></font>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Tree </h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Trees are used to sort data into left and right nodes. The root is the first node and has no parents. Parents are  </p>
		<p class="handwriting">the nodes which give out to others. Leafs are at the bottom and only have parents. It is sorted by having < or > on eitherside of the tree.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">It then sorts the data by checking each data point and travelling left or right depending on it's value.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">The advantages </p>
		<font color="green"><p class="handwriting">Reads and sorts data quickly: 0(logn) </p></font>
		
		<p class="handwriting">The dis-advantages </p>
		<font color="orange"><p class="handwriting">complex to understand</p></font>
		<font color="orange"><p class="handwriting">Takes longer to modify list: 0(logn)</p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">When reading a tree, we always start b going down the left hand side.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">We use Pre-traversal to gather the furthest left values as it travels round the list.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">We use Post-order traversal which gathers the furthest right value.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">We use In-order traversal by getting the lowest value as it goes round each time.</p>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Graph </h4></font><img src="assets/graph.png" alt="graph" width=160 height=100></img>
		<p class="handwriting">A data type which stores data in a grid mapped way where each data item links to another via a value.  </p>
		<p class="handwriting">The data structure uses an adjacency list to store the way in which the graph is linked.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">It also uses an adjacency matrix which gathers all the links to data. A = {B:4,C:7} means A links to B via value 4 and C via value 7</p>
		<p class="handwriting">The advantages </p>
		<font color="green"><p class="handwriting">Easy way to link data items </p></font>
		
		<p class="handwriting">The dis-advantages </p>
		<font color="orange"><p class="handwriting">Complex to understand</p></font>
		<font color="orange"><p class="handwriting">Can take years to find the shortest distance to a point.</p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Values can be bi-directional where they have multiple and go both wasy, instead of mono-directional.</p>
