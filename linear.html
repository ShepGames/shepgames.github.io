		<h3 class="niceText">Linear interpolation</h3>
		
		<p class="handwriting">Linear interpolation is estimating a value in a set of data.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">You are typically asked to find the value of a certain way through the data set. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">You will need to find ther percentage through.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">The first step is to look at your data and make sure you have the cumulative frequency, make sure the range of data is in the right form. </p>
			<p class="handwriting">By this I mean, when the data is between two values, it makes sure there is no ignored values.</p>
		<p class="handwriting"> 1&lt;x&lt;5,5&lt;x&lt;10 has nothing missing</p>
		<p class="handwriting"> 1&lt;x&lt;4,5&lt;x&lt;10 has missing data, so needs to be changed to 1&lt;x&lt;4.5,4.5&lt;x&lt;10</p>
		
		<p class="handwriting">You then need to work out the value (percentile) you want. This is done by getting the value you are asked to find, </p>
		<p class="handwriting">and dividing it into your total amount of data.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">We then use the formula which is: </p>
		<p class="handwriting">Lower_class_boundary + (How_many_in)/(Group total) * class_width </p>
		
		<font color="blue"><h4>Example </h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">1)Find an estimate mean value from the following set of data:</p>
		<img src="assets/cf.bmp" alt="table">
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">The class width has no missing values, so I will leave that as it is. </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">We have the cumulative frequency already here, and know that Î£x = 21 </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">We want the mean, which will be somewhere in the middle. 21/2 = 10.5th value. </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">This will be in the 30-35 set of data, as 10.5 is included in 15. </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">This is the lower class boundary of 30</p>
			<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">how may in is the value we want-the value before so 10.5-10 =0.5</p>
				<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">The total group which is 15</p>
				<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">And its group width is 5</p>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">We will have: 30+ (10.5)/(15) *5 = 33.5</p></font>
