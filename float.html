		<p class="handwriting">Normal decimal numbers can be represented with standard form. So can binary numbers</p>
		<p class="handwriting">We can represent Binary using the 8 4 2 1 base 2, and can do the other side of the decimal point. 8 2 4 1.0.5 0.25 0.125 and so on</p>
		<p class="handwriting">Some numbers are too big or too small to fit in a normal 8-bit number, this is where we use a mantissa and an exponent.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">The Mantissa is the Binary number you are given.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">The exponent is the number of places you are moving to. It is all in base two so the exponent 2 to the power of the number given.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">010010 0110 is the typical way of writing this. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">In every question like this we add a decimal point in-between the first digit and the second digit of the mantissa. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">Be aware that if this is in a sign and magnitude you will need to have the first character of both the exponent and mantissa as a negative number</p>
		<p class="handwriting">Positive exponents move the <font color="green">decimal right</font>, and negative to <font color="green">the left</font></p>
		<font color="blue"><p class="handwriting">Example: </p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">1)Normalize 1001101 0101 </p>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Firstly we convert the exponent to denary, in order to know how many places to move by. This is 5</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Because the data is signed we must stay aware if the number was 1101 it would be -5</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Add in the decimal point, then slide it 5 places right: 1.001101 --> 100110.1</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Our normalized number is: 100110.1 and in denery -6.5 as it is signed</p></font>
