		<p class="handwriting">Logic gates are ways to represent logic in a system.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">Typically we learn AND NOT OR. </p>
		<img src="assets/logicGates.png" alt="Logic gate" height="200" width="260">
		<p class="handwriting">AND needs both inputs to be true. 1+1=1</p>
		<p class="handwriting">NOT reverses the input. 1=0 and 0=1</p>
		<p class="handwriting">OR needs at least one input to be true. 1+0=1 1+1=1</p>
		<p class="handwriting">XOR needs at one input to be true. 1+0=1 1+1=0</p>
		<p class="handwriting">NAND or NOR is NOT AND and NOT OR. This just reverses the normal logic gate.</p>
		<font color="blue"><p class="handwriting">Example: </p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">1)Express the system with logic gates where buttons A and B must be true OR NOT C AND D</p>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Firstly we write out inputs: A,B,C,D</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">We know that A AND B OR NOT C and D</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">We draw A and B as an AND logic gate next to C and D as a NAND gate.</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">This will be connected by an OR gate, because the question says one of the gates must be true.</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">This is what it should look like (sorry for bad drawing)</p></font>

		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Boolean algebra </h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Boolean algebra is a way of writing logic as an equation.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">Like algebra, we represent the inputs and outputs as letters. We then use symbols to represent gates.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">NOT is ¬</p>
		<p class="handwriting">AND is '^'. It can also be represented by being multiplied by the other digit</p>
		<p class="handwriting">OR is v </p>
		<p class="handwriting">XOR is ⊕ </p>
		<p class="handwriting">In exams you will be asked to simplify logic expressions. There are methods like DeMorgan's laws and Karnough maps</p>
		<p class="handwriting">DeMorgan's laws are tricky to remember, but uses basic mathematical principles.</p>
