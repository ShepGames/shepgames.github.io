	<h3 class="niceText">SUVAT</h3>
		<p class="handwriting">Suvat is an easy way to remember the components of movement. (in m)</p>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	S = displacement, which is the distance travelled ()</p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	U = the initial velocity, which is the speed the object is going at from when it starts (in ms^-1)</p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	V = the final velocity, which is the speed of the object at the end (in ms^-1)</p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	A = the acceleration, which is the rate of increase in speed (in ms^-2)</p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	T = the time it took (in seconds)</p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Suvat is all about finding out what you do and do not have. There are formulas which require a minimum of 3 of these values.</p>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	V=U+AT </p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	V²=U²=2AS </p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	S=T(U+V)/2 </p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	S=UT+0.5AT²</p></font>
		<font color="red"><p class="handwriting"> 	S=VT-0.5AT²</p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Once you have 3 of the SUVAT letters, you will pick the best suited equation </p>
		<p class="handwriting">and subing in your values. SUVAT is your basic toolkit for movement in maths.</p>
		
		<font color="blue"><p class="handwriting">Example: </p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">1) A train passes through the point A, with a velocity of 40ms^(-1) which is 100m away from point B. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">i)being it took 2 seconds, what is the velocity at B?</p>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Firstly we want to pick out the infomation we have. We know that </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">A to B is 100m. Drawing diagrams in maths is reall helpful.</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">A-------------------------50m------------------------B </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">U = 40, as it passes A. We want to find V as it passes B. The time is given as 2s </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">We must look for an equation with S, U, T and V in. This is S=T(U+V)/2  </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Re-arrange to make T the subject, (2S/T)-U=V  </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">2(100)/2 - 40=V     Therefore V = 60ms^(-1) </p></font>
		
		
	<h3 class="niceText">Projectiles</h3>
		<p class="handwriting">Projectiles use suvat equations, but require a bit more thought. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">If a particle is projected upwards it has only one component, if it is projected across it has two, a vertical and a horizontal. </p>
		
		<img src="assets/projectile.png" alt="projectile" width="300" height="100">
		<p class="handwriting">The above shows the projectile going up and down again. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">We split it into two suvats, vertical and horizontal. With the Vertical we know that A=-9.8 when going up, and A=9.8 going down.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">This is becuase of gravity. We know that when going up, the maximum velocity is 0, before falling back down.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">With the horizontal we know that A=0 because there is no acceleration on a horizontal component. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">T is the same for both, so can be made to equal eachother in order to use simultanious equations if needed. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">    ---------      </p>
		<font color="blue"><p class="handwriting">Example: </p></font>
		<p class="handwriting">2) A particle is projected vertically upwards from point O with speed, u m/s. 2 seconds later it is still moving upwards </p>
		<p class="handwriting">and it's speed is 1/3u m/s.</p>
		<p class="handwriting">i)Find the value of u</p>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">We set out our SUVAT. S=?,U=u,V=1/3u,A=-9.8,T=2 </p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Even though we only have two proper values, we can sub in the u in V=U+AT</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">1/3u=u-9.8(2)</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">-> -2/3u=-19.6</p></font>
		<font color="grey"><p class="handwriting">Therefore u = 29.4 m/s</p></font>
