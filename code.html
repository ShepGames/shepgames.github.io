		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Code optimization </h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Improve code quality and efficiency. A program may be optimized so that it becomes smaller in file size. </p>
		<p class="handwriting">This is done by removing unused variables, calculations made more efficient and removing other parts of the code which is unused.  </p>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Intermediate </h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Run on a variaty of computer architecture. Code is possibly produced from different languages.  </p>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Decomposition</h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Breaking complex problems of a system into parts that are easier to understand, program and maintain. </p>
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Object oriented</h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Code which creates objects to manage it's own variables and data.  </p>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Procedural </h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Code which reads one line at a time of uor program, it uses the variables in program and is alot easier to understand.  </p>
		<p class="handwriting">Normal programming languages like C and most of the time Python are procederal.</p>
		
		<font color="red"><h4 class="handwriting">Event driven</h4></font>
		<p class="handwriting">Code which does not run unless it is called upon. Javascript is gets called by HTML to run a function, this is event driven. </p>
